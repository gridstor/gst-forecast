## 🔴 Action Required: Main Site API Routing

### The Issue
Your documented API routing fix needs to be applied to the **main site** repository (`gridstoranalytics.com`), not this sub-site.

### What Needs to Happen

**In the MAIN site repository** (gridstoranalytics-main or similar):

Edit `netlify.toml` to add these redirects **BEFORE** any existing redirects:

```toml
# ========================================
# API Routing - Must be BEFORE page routes
# ========================================

# Gridstor Admin & Curve APIs
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/admin*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/api/admin:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/curves*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/api/curves:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/delivery*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/api/delivery:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/delivery-request*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/api/delivery-request:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/curve-upload*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/api/curve-upload:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

# Market Ops APIs (fallback)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://gridstordayzer.netlify.app/api/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = false

# ========================================
# Page Routing - After API routes
# ========================================

# Gridstor Pages
[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/admin/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = false

[[redirects]]
  from = "/revenue-forecasts/*"
  to = "https://gridstor.netlify.app/revenue-forecasts/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = false

# ... rest of your page redirects
```

## 🧪 Local Testing (This Works Now!)

### Test Locally Before Deploying
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test endpoints (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:4321/api/curves/definitions
# Should return: JSON array of definitions ✅

curl http://localhost:4321/api/curves/instances?definitionId=12
# Should return: JSON with instances ✅
```

### Access Upload Page Locally
```
http://localhost:4321/admin/upload
```

**Status:** ✅ Works perfectly in local dev!

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy This Sub-Site (gridstor)
```bash
# From this directory
git add .
git commit -m "Rebuild admin upload page with clean 3-section flow"
git push origin main
```

**Result:** 
- New upload page deployed to `gridstor.netlify.app`
- Available at `gridstor.netlify.app/admin/upload`
- **BUT** still needs main site routing to work at gridstoranalytics.com

### Step 2: Update Main Site Routing
1. **Navigate to main site repository**
2. **Edit `netlify.toml`** - Add API redirects (see above)
3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add netlify.toml
   git commit -m "Add API routing for gridstor admin endpoints"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Production
After both sites deploy:

```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl https://gridstoranalytics.com/api/curves/definitions

# Should return: JSON array (not HTML 404) ✅
```

### Step 4: Access Upload Page
```
https://gridstoranalytics.com/admin/upload
```

**Expected:** Page loads, definitions list populates, no 404 errors ✅

## ✅ Final Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Sub-site deployed (this repo) ✅
- [ ] Main site `netlify.toml` updated with API redirects
- [ ] Main site deployed

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: "I get 404 on API calls"**  
A: Check main site `netlify.toml` has the API redirects (Step 2 above)

**Q: "Page loads but no definitions"**  
A: Database might be empty. Add test data via Prisma Studio or API

**Q: "Template generator not working"**  
A: Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Verify dates/granularity selected.

**Q: "Upload fails with validation error"**  
A: Verify CSV format, timestamps in ISO 8601, timestamps within delivery period

## 🎯 Ready to Deploy!

This sub-site is **production-ready**. Just need the main site API routing update to make it accessible at `gridstoranalytics.com/admin/upload`.

**Next step:** Update main site `netlify.toml` with the API redirects documented above.
