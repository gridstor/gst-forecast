# Asset Loading 404 Errors - FIXED ✅

## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified**

The 404 errors were caused by **hardcoded URLs in `astro.config.mjs`** that were forcing assets to load from specific domains instead of the current sub-site domain.

### **Problematic Configuration:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - This was causing the issues
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://gridstor.netlify.app',        // Hardcoded site URL
  build: {
    assets: '_astro'
  },
  vite: {
    define: {
      'import.meta.env.ASSET_URL': JSON.stringify('https://gridstor.netlify.app')  // Hardcoded asset URL
    }
  }
});
```

### **The Problem:**
- **Assets trying to load from wrong domain**: `https://gridstoranalytics.com/_astro/...`
- **Should load from sub-site domain**: `https://your-subsite.netlify.app/_astro/...`
- **Netlify proxy couldn't find assets** because they don't exist on the main domain

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Corrected Configuration:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Let sub-site serve from its own domain
export default defineConfig({
  // Remove site URL - let it serve from its own domain
  // This allows Netlify proxies to work correctly
  integrations: [react(), tailwind()],
  output: 'server',
  adapter: netlify(),
  vite: {
    build: {
      rollupOptions: {
        external: ['@prisma/client']
      }
    }
    // Remove ASSET_URL definition - let assets load from current domain
  }
});
```

### **Key Changes:**
1. **Removed `site` property** - No hardcoded domain
2. **Removed `build.assets` configuration**
3. **Removed `ASSET_URL` definition** - Let Astro use relative paths
4. **Clean build configuration** - Only essential settings

## 🚀 **Expected Results After Deployment**

Once deployed to Netlify:

### **✅ Assets Load Correctly:**
- `https://your-subsite.netlify.app/_astro/CurveViewer.Ce2-sCzS.js` ✅
- `https://your-subsite.netlify.app/_astro/client.CyyDrSAY.js` ✅
- All CSS and JS files load from sub-site domain ✅

### **✅ No More 404 Errors:**
- No more failed asset loading
- No more hydration errors
- CurveViewer component loads properly

### **✅ Proxy Still Works:**
- User visits: `gridstoranalytics.com/forecasts/`
- Main site proxies to: `your-subsite.netlify.app/`
- Assets load from: `your-subsite.netlify.app/_astro/`
- User sees: `gridstoranalytics.com/forecasts/` in URL bar

## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

After deployment:
- [ ] Navigate to curve viewer page
- [ ] Check browser console - no 404 errors
- [ ] Verify CurveViewer component loads and functions
- [ ] Confirm all CSS styles load properly
- [ ] Test navigation between pages
- [ ] Verify charts and interactive elements work

## 📝 **Key Lesson**

**For Netlify Proxies:** 
- ❌ **Don't hardcode** `site` URLs in sub-sites
- ❌ **Don't define** custom asset URLs
- ✅ **Let Astro use** relative paths and current domain
- ✅ **Let Netlify handle** the domain routing via proxy

This approach ensures assets load from the correct domain while maintaining the seamless user experience of the proxy setup!
