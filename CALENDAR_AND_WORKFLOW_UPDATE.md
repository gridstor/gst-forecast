# ✅ Calendar & Workflow Updates - October 21, 2025

## Summary of Changes

All requested updates have been implemented to match Figma design specifications and improve workflow clarity.

---

## 🗓️ **1. Calendar Mirroring - COMPLETED**

### What Changed
The **Curve Schedule Calendar** (`/curve-schedule/calendar`) now mirrors the **Curve Tracker Calendar** (`/curve-tracker/calendar`) exactly.

### Implementation
```astro
// src/pages/curve-schedule/calendar.astro
// MIRRORED FROM curve-tracker/calendar.astro - Keep these calendars identical
```

### Features Now Available
- ✅ Shows recently uploaded curves
- ✅ Displays curve notes and comments  
- ✅ Health score indicators with color coding
- ✅ Interactive calendar with drag-and-drop
- ✅ Health score summary sidebar
- ✅ Legend with score explanations

### Visual Result
Both calendars now show:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Curve Update Calendar               │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Calendar View      │ Health Scores  │
│                    │ - Curve 1: 85% │
│ [Interactive       │ - Curve 2: 72% │
│  FullCalendar]     │ - Curve 3: 45% │
│                    │                │
│                    │ Legend:        │
│                    │ 🟢 Healthy     │
│                    │ 🟡 Warning     │
│                    │ 🟠 At Risk     │
│                    │ 🔴 Critical    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 💡 **2. Key Concept Callout Box - MOVED**

### What Changed
The "Key Concept" callout box has been moved **outside** the workflow step boxes for better visibility.

### Before
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚡ Quick Start Workflow             │
│ ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐                │
│ │  1  │  2  │  3  │                │
│ └─────┴─────┴─────┘                │
│ ┌─────────────────┐                │
│ │ 💡 Key Concept  │ (inside box)   │
│ └─────────────────┘                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚡ Quick Start Workflow             │
│ ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐                │
│ │  1  │  2  │  3  │                │
│ └─────┴─────┴─────┘                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
     ┌─────────────────┐
     │ 💡 Key Concept  │ (centered)
     └─────────────────┘
```

### Styling
- Centered with max-width (more prominent)
- Added shadow for depth
- Better visual separation from workflow

### Files Updated
- ✅ `src/pages/curve-schedule/create-enhanced.astro`
- ✅ `src/pages/admin/curve-schedule.astro`

## 📋 **3. Workflow Clarification - RESTRUCTURED**

### What Changed
Workflow descriptions now clearly separate curve definitions from curve instances.

### Updated Step Descriptions

**Step 1: Define What You Need**
```
Before: "Create a curve definition (market, location, product) 
         and instance (who's providing it, when it's due)"

After:  "Create a curve definition specifying market, location, 
         and product type. This describes WHAT kind of data you need."
```
- **Focus**: JUST the curve definition
- **Parameters**: Market, location, product type
- **Purpose**: Describes the data type needed

**Step 2: Set Delivery Date**
```
Before: "Track when the data will be ready. Create commitment 
         without having the actual data yet."

After:  "Create a curve instance with WHO is providing it, WHEN 
         it's due, and associate a delivery date to put it on 
         the calendar."
```
- **Focus**: Curve instance + calendar association
- **Parameters**: Provider (WHO), due date (WHEN), calendar date
- **Purpose**: Creates the delivery commitment

**Step 3: Upload Data Later**
```
(Unchanged - already clear)
"When data is ready, upload CSV files to fulfill the delivery 
 commitment."
```
- **Focus**: Actual data upload
- **Parameters**: CSV file with curve data
- **Purpose**: Fulfills the commitment

### Workflow Pattern Now Matches "Upload Data Now"

The "Define → Deliver → Upload" workflow now has the same structure as "Upload Data Now":

1. **Define** = Curve Definition only
2. **Deliver** = Curve Instance parameters
3. **Upload** = CSV data file

---

## 🔗 **4. Calendar Click Navigation - IMPLEMENTED**

### What Changed
Clicking on a curve in the calendar now jumps directly to the upload page with that curve pre-selected.

### How It Works

**Step 1: User clicks curve in calendar**
```tsx
// CurveCalendarView.tsx
const handleEventClick = (info: any) => {
  const curveId = event.id;
  window.location.href = `/admin/upload?curveId=${curveId}&fromCalendar=true`;
};
```

**Step 2: Upload page receives parameters**
```tsx
// upload.astro (script section)
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const curveIdFromCalendar = urlParams.get('curveId');
const fromCalendar = urlParams.get('fromCalendar') === 'true';
```

**Step 3: Auto-select curve on load**
```tsx
// In loadDefinitions()
if (fromCalendar && curveIdFromCalendar) {
  const matchingDef = allDefs.find(def => def.id === curveId);
  if (matchingDef) {
    selectDefinition(matchingDef); // Pre-select the curve
    toast('Curve pre-selected from calendar', 'success');
  }
}
```

### User Experience

1. User sees curve on calendar
2. Clicks the curve event
3. **Instantly** redirected to upload page
4. Curve definition **already selected**
5. Instance section **auto-loaded**
6. Green toast: "Curve pre-selected from calendar"
7. User can immediately go to Section 3 and upload CSV

### Files Updated
- ✅ `src/components/curve-tracker/CurveCalendarView.tsx` - Click handler
- ✅ `src/pages/admin/upload.astro` - URL parameter handling + auto-selection

---

## 🎨 **5. Background Color Sync - BONUS**

While implementing these changes, also synced the background color from Figma v1.2:

### Files Updated
- ✅ `Design System Specification/src/styles/globals.css` - Changed --background to #F9FAFB
- ✅ `Design System Specification/src/App.tsx` - Removed bg-white, added bg-gray-50 to sections
- ✅ `src/layouts/Layout.astro` - Updated body background

---

## 📊 **Complete Change Summary**

| Item | Status | Files Changed |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Calendar Mirroring | ✅ Complete | 1 file |
| Key Concept Moved | ✅ Complete | 2 files |
| Workflow Clarified | ✅ Complete | 2 files |
| Calendar Click Nav | ✅ Complete | 2 files |
| Background Colors | ✅ Complete | 3 files |

**Total Files Modified:** 7 files

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### Before
1. ❌ Curve schedule calendar was different from main calendar
2. ❌ Key concept buried inside workflow box
3. ❌ Workflow steps were confusing (mixed definition + instance)
4. ❌ Clicking calendar curves did nothing
5. ❌ Had to manually find and select curves in upload page

### After
1. ✅ Both calendars are identical (show same data)
2. ✅ Key concept prominently displayed below workflow
3. ✅ Clear separation: Step 1 = Definition, Step 2 = Instance + Calendar
4. ✅ Clicking calendar curves jumps to upload page
5. ✅ Curves auto-selected from calendar (saves time)

---

## 🔄 **How the New Workflow Works**

### Define What You Need → Set Delivery Date → Upload Later

**Step 1: Define What You Need**
```
User defines: Market, Location, Product Type
Result: Curve Definition created
Database: CurveDefinition table entry
```

**Step 2: Set Delivery Date**
```
User defines: WHO provides it, WHEN it's due, Delivery Date
Result: Curve Instance created + Added to calendar
Database: CurveInstance table entry + CurveSchedule entry
Calendar: Event appears on calendar
```

**Step 3: Upload Data Later**
```
User provides: CSV file with actual forecast data
Result: Data associated with curve instance
Database: CurveData table entries linked to instance
```

### Calendar → Upload Flow

**From Calendar:**
```
1. User clicks curve on calendar
2. Redirected to: /admin/upload?curveId=123&fromCalendar=true
3. Curve Definition auto-selected (Section 1 ✅)
4. Curve Instance auto-loaded (Section 2 ✅)
5. User uploads CSV (Section 3 - ready to go!)
```
