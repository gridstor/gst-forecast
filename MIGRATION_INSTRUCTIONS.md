# Database Migration Complete - Next Steps

## What Was Changed

### Database Schema:
✅ `CurveInstance` fields converted to arrays:
- `curveType` → `curveTypes` (array)
- `commodity` → `commodities` (array)  
- `scenario` → `scenarios` (array)
- GIN indexes added for fast array searches

✅ All existing data migrated (3 instances converted)

### UI Updates:
✅ Upload page - Tag-based multi-select for types, commodities, scenarios
✅ Inventory page - Same multi-select editing
✅ Detail panels - Show colored tags for all values
✅ Link instances to schedules/requests
✅ Schedule management - Edit/delete/change dates/status

### API Updates:
✅ create-instance.ts - Handles arrays
✅ edit-curve-instance.ts - Handles arrays
✅ curve-field-values.ts - Flattens arrays to get unique values
✅ curves/list.ts - Returns arrays
✅ curves/data.ts - Queries arrays
✅ curves/data-with-pvalues.ts - Handles arrays
✅ by-location-enhanced.ts - Uses arrays

## To Complete Setup:

1. **Stop dev server** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Regenerate Prisma Client:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

3. **Restart dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## New Capabilities:

### Multi-Value Instance Support:
- Upload curves with **multiple curve types** (e.g., P-Values + Revenue Forecast)
- **Multiple commodities** (e.g., EA Revenue + AS Revenue + Total)
- **Multiple scenarios** (e.g., Base + High + Low)
- Options auto-populate from database
- Click + dropdown to add values, click ✕ to remove

### Schedule-to-Delivery Tracking:
- Create Quick Requests (ad-hoc deliveries)
- Create Recurring Schedules (regular cadence)
- Link curve instances to requests when uploading
- Auto-mark requests as COMPLETED when fulfilled
- View which instances fulfilled which requests
- Edit schedules: change dates, priority, status, notes
- Delete schedules from calendar

### Both Calendars Sync:
- `/revenue-forecasts/admin` and `/curve-schedule` show identical data
- Scheduled items (📅) color-coded by priority
- Uploaded instances (⬆️) shown in blue
- Both types appear together

## Database Tables Created:
- CurveDefinition
- CurveInstance
- PriceForecast
- CurveData
- CurveSchedule
- ScheduleRun
- CurveInputLineage
- VersionHistory
- QualityMetric
- DefaultCurveInput
- CurveInstanceTemplate

All production-ready with indexes, constraints, and triggers!
