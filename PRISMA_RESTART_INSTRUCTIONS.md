# Restart Dev Server and Regenerate Prisma

The Prisma client needs to be regenerated but there's a file lock.

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Regenerate Prisma client:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test the edit functionality** at:
   - http://localhost:4321/admin/inventory

## What Was Fixed:

1. ✅ Autocomplete now shows ONLY database values (not cluttered with unused enums)
2. ✅ Added better error logging to edit endpoint
3. ✅ Dropdowns will be clean and show only what's actually in use

## After Restart:

The dropdowns should show:
- Only markets actually in your database
- Only battery durations you've used
- Only scenarios you've used
- Only degradation types you've used
- "+" Add New Value" option for each to add more when needed

This keeps everything clean and prevents clutter!
