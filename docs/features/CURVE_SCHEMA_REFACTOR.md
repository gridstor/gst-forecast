# Curve Schema Refactor: Move curveType and commodity to Instance Level

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Schema Updated, üöß Migration Ready, ‚úÖ Inventory Updated

## Problem Statement

Previously, `curveType` and `commodity` were fields on `CurveDefinition`, forcing users to create separate definitions for related curves that are commonly used together.

### Example: Before
```
CurveDefinition: "SP15 Gridstor Optimized Total Revenue"
  - curveType: "REVENUE"
  - commodity: "Energy"

CurveDefinition: "SP15 Gridstor Optimized Energy Arbitrage"
  - curveType: "ENERGY_ARB"
  - commodity: "Energy"

CurveDefinition: "SP15 Gridstor Optimized Ancillary Services"
  - curveType: "AS"
  - commodity: "Ancillary Services"
```

This required creating 3 separate definitions for what is essentially the same project revenue forecast.

## Solution

Move `curveType` and `commodity` from `CurveDefinition` to `CurveInstance`, allowing a single definition to have multiple instances with different types and commodities.

### Example: After
```
CurveDefinition: "SP15 Gridstor Optimized Revenue"
  - market: "CAISO"
  - location: "SP15"
  - product: "Gridstor Optimized"
  
  Instances:
    - Instance 1:
        curveType: "REVENUE"
        commodity: "Total Revenue"
        instanceVersion: "v1.0"
    
    - Instance 2:
        curveType: "ENERGY_ARB"
        commodity: "Energy"
        instanceVersion: "v1.0"
    
    - Instance 3:
        curveType: "AS"
        commodity: "Ancillary Services"
        instanceVersion: "v1.0"
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Organization**: One definition for related curves
2. **Better Semantics**: Definition describes the general curve, instance specifies the specific type
3. **Flexible Uploads**: Upload multiple related curves in a single session
4. **Easier Project Finance**: Keep all project revenue components together
5. **Better Discussion**: Natural grouping for conversations about project revenue

## Schema Changes

### CurveDefinition

**Removed Fields:**
- `curveType` (VARCHAR(100))
- `commodity` (VARCHAR(50))

**Updated Index:**
- ‚ùå Removed: `idx_curveType_batteryDuration_scenario`
- ‚úÖ Added: `idx_batteryDuration_scenario`

### CurveInstance

**Added Fields:**
- `curveType` (VARCHAR(100), nullable) - e.g., "REVENUE", "ENERGY_ARB", "AS"
- `commodity` (VARCHAR(50), nullable) - e.g., "Energy", "Capacity", "Ancillary Services"

**Added Index:**
- ‚úÖ New: `idx_curveType_commodity` - for efficient filtering

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Run Migration SQL

File: `prisma/migrations/20251024_move_curvetype_commodity_to_instance.sql`

```sql
-- Add columns to CurveInstance
ALTER TABLE "Forecasts"."CurveInstance"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "curveType" VARCHAR(100),
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "commodity" VARCHAR(50);

-- Migrate existing data
UPDATE "Forecasts"."CurveInstance" ci
SET 
  "curveType" = cd."curveType",
  "commodity" = cd."commodity"
FROM "Forecasts"."CurveDefinition" cd
WHERE ci."curveDefinitionId" = cd.id
  AND ci."curveType" IS NULL;

-- Create new index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "CurveInstance_curveType_commodity_idx" 
  ON "Forecasts"."CurveInstance"("curveType", "commodity");
```

**Note:** The old columns on `CurveDefinition` are NOT automatically dropped for safety. Drop them manually after verifying the migration.

### Step 2: Update Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 3: Restart Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Updated Components

### ‚úÖ Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

**CurveDefinition:**
- Removed `curveType` and `commodity` fields
- Updated comments to document the change
- Updated index to remove `curveType`

**CurveInstance:**
- Added `curveType` and `commodity` fields (nullable)
- Added new index on these fields
- Added documentation comments

### ‚úÖ Curve Inventory Page (`src/pages/curve-tracker/inventory.astro`)

**Major Changes:**
1. **Data Loading**: Now fetches definitions + instances
2. **Filters**: Changed from "Mark Type/Case" to "Curve Type/Commodity"
3. **Table Display**: Shows curve types and commodities as badges
4. **Stats**: Updated to show instance counts instead of price points

**New Features:**
- Visual badges for curve types (blue) and commodities (green)
- Filter by curve type or commodity
- Shows instance count per definition
- Groups related curves under one definition

### üöß Curve Uploader (Pending)

**TODO**: Update uploader form to:
1. Select or create definition (without curveType/commodity)
2. Set curveType and commodity for each instance being uploaded
3. Support uploading multiple instances (different types) in one session

### üöß API Endpoints (Pending)

**Endpoints to Update:**
- `/api/curves/definitions` - Already works (no curveType in response)
- `/api/curves/instances` - Need to add curveType and commodity to response
- `/api/curve-upload/create-definition` - Remove curveType and commodity params
- `/api/curve-upload/create-instance` - Add curveType and commodity params
- Any other endpoints that query or filter by curveType

## Database Compatibility

### Backwards Compatibility

The migration is designed to be **non-breaking**:

1. ‚úÖ Existing data is migrated automatically
2. ‚úÖ Old columns remain until manually dropped
3. ‚úÖ New columns are nullable, so existing code continues to work
4. ‚úÖ Indexes are added, not replaced (old index remains)

### Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. The old `curveType` and `commodity` columns still exist on `CurveDefinition`
2. Simply revert the Prisma schema changes
3. Drop the new columns from `CurveInstance`:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "Forecasts"."CurveInstance" 
     DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "curveType",
     DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "commodity";
   ```

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps

1. **View Inventory**:
   - Navigate to `/curve-tracker/inventory`
   - Verify curve definitions display correctly
   - Check that instance types show as badges
   - Test filtering by curve type and commodity

2. **Create New Curve**:
   - Go to `/curve-tracker/upload`
   - Create a new definition (e.g., "Test Revenue Bundle")
   - Upload instances with different curveTypes
   - Verify they appear under the same definition

3. **API Testing**:
   - Check `/api/curves/definitions` returns correct data
   - Check `/api/curves/instances?definitionId=X` includes curveType and commodity
   - Verify filters work correctly

### Expected Results

‚úÖ **Inventory Page**:
- Definitions group related curves
- Badge display for types and commodities
- Filters work correctly
- Stats show correct counts

‚úÖ **Database**:
- New columns exist on CurveInstance
- Data migrated from CurveDefinition
- Indexes created successfully

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Run Migration SQL** - Execute the migration script
2. **Update Uploader** - Modify upload flow to set curveType/commodity on instance
3. **Update Upload API** - Adjust create-definition and create-instance endpoints
4. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify no regressions

### Future (Optional)

1. **Drop Old Columns** - After confirming everything works:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "Forecasts"."CurveDefinition" 
     DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "curveType",
     DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "commodity";
   ```

2. **Batch Upload UI** - Create interface for uploading multiple instance types at once

3. **Instance Comparison** - Add UI to compare different instances (total revenue vs energy arb)

## Use Cases

### Project Finance Analysis

**Before**: Had to look at 3+ separate curve definitions  
**After**: All project revenue components under one definition

```
Definition: "Moss Landing BESS Revenue - Q4 2024"
  Instances:
    - Total Revenue (REVENUE)
    - Energy Arbitrage (ENERGY_ARB) 
    - Frequency Regulation (AS - Frequency)
    - Spinning Reserve (AS - Spinning)
```

### Multi-Commodity Projects

```
Definition: "CAISO Hybrid Solar+Storage"
  Instances:
    - Energy Revenue (ENERGY)
    - Capacity Revenue (CAPACITY)
    - Ancillary Services (AS)
    - REC Revenue (REC)
```

### Scenario Planning

```
Definition: "ERCOT Hub Average - 2025 Forecast"
  Instances:
    - Base Case Revenue (BASE)
    - High Case Revenue (HIGH)
    - Low Case Revenue (LOW)
```

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `prisma/schema.prisma`
- ‚úÖ `prisma/migrations/20251024_move_curvetype_commodity_to_instance.sql`
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/curve-tracker/inventory.astro`
- üöß `src/pages/curve-tracker/upload.astro` (pending)
- üöß `src/pages/api/curve-upload/*.ts` (pending)
- üìÑ `docs/features/CURVE_SCHEMA_REFACTOR.md` (this document)

## Notes

- This is a **structural improvement** that makes the data model more flexible
- It aligns with how project finance teams think about revenue curves
- The migration is designed to be **safe and reversible**
- Existing queries will continue to work during the transition
- Full backwards compatibility maintained until old columns are manually dropped
