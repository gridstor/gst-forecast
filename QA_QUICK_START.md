## 🚨 When to Delay Rollout

### Red Flags
- ❌ Critical bugs unresolved
- ❌ Tests failing
- ❌ Performance targets not met
- ❌ Alpha testers report major issues
- ❌ Documentation incomplete
- ❌ Support team not ready

### Yellow Flags (Proceed with Caution)
- ⚠️ Minor bugs present (document as known issues)
- ⚠️ Some testers need extra training
- ⚠️ Performance close to but not quite at target
- ⚠️ Limited browser testing

**Decision Rule:** If 2+ red flags OR 3+ yellow flags → Delay rollout

## 💬 Questions?

### FAQ

**Q: This seems like a lot. Do we need all of it?**
A: You can scale based on your org size. Minimum: complete alpha testing, basic documentation, and manual testing before rollout.

**Q: We're a small team (5 people). Can we simplify?**
A: Yes! Combine alpha and beta into one 2-week testing phase with your whole team. Still create documentation.

**Q: We need to launch ASAP. What's the minimum?**
A: 
1. Fix all P0 bugs
2. Test critical workflows (Suite 2 from TESTING_SCRIPT.md)
3. Create 1-page Quick Start guide
4. Set up support channel
5. Launch with close monitoring

**Q: Who should lead this?**
A: Ideally someone who understands both the business domain and the technical system. Can be product manager, senior developer, or QA lead.

**Q: What if we find critical bugs during beta?**
A: Fix them before full rollout! That's the point of beta testing. Extend beta phase if needed.
