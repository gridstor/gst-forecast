# 🚀 Final Restart Instructions

## What Was Completed

### Phase 1 (Earlier)
✅ Moved `curveType` and `commodity` to CurveInstance

### Phase 2 (Just Now)
✅ Moved `granularity`, `scenario`, `degradationType` to CurveInstance  
✅ Removed `product` from CurveDefinition  
✅ Fixed all API endpoints  
✅ Updated UI components  
✅ Updated Prisma schema  
✅ Ran database migrations  

## Migration Results

```
📊 Both Migrations Completed:

Phase 1:
  ✅ 3 instances migrated with curveType & commodity

Phase 2:
  ✅ 3 instances migrated with granularity, scenario, degradationType
  
Total: 3/3 instances (100% success rate)
```

## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running npm run dev)

# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**Why?**
- Prisma client needs to reload with the new schema
- File locks will be released
- `npx prisma generate` will complete on restart

### Step 2: Test Everything

Once server is running:

```bash
# In a new terminal, run API tests:
npx tsx scripts/test-api-endpoints.ts
```

Expected: **100% pass rate** (10/10 endpoints)

### Step 3: Visual Verification

Visit these pages:

1. **Curve Inventory**: http://localhost:4321/curve-tracker/inventory
   - Should show curve names without product/type in the name
   - Should show colorful badges for instance types and commodities
   - Filters should work

2. **API Health Check**: http://localhost:4321/admin/api-health
   - Click "Run All Tests"
   - Should show mostly green checkmarks

## 📊 New Schema Structure

### CurveDefinition (Ultra-Simple)
```
Only the essentials:
  ✓ curveName: "SP15 Battery Revenue"
  ✓ market: "CAISO"
  ✓ location: "SP15"
  ✓ batteryDuration: "4H"
  ✓ units: "$/MWh"
  ✓ timezone: "UTC"
```

### CurveInstance (All the Details)
```
Every variant can differ:
  ✓ curveType: "Revenue Forecast" or "Price Forecast"
  ✓ commodity: "Total Revenue" or "EA Revenue" or "AS Revenue"
  ✓ granularity: "MONTHLY" or "QUARTERLY" or "ANNUAL"
  ✓ scenario: "BASE" or "HIGH" or "LOW"
  ✓ degradationType: "NONE" or "YEAR_1" or "YEAR_5" or "YEAR_10"
  + deliveryPeriodStart, deliveryPeriodEnd
  + forecastRunDate, freshnessStartDate
  + status, modelType, createdBy, etc.
```

## 🎯 Example

### One Definition
```
"SP15 Battery Revenue"
  - Market: CAISO
  - Location: SP15
  - Battery: 4H
```

### Many Instances
```
Instance 1: Revenue Forecast, Total Revenue, MONTHLY, BASE, NONE
Instance 2: Revenue Forecast, Total Revenue, MONTHLY, HIGH, NONE
Instance 3: Revenue Forecast, Total Revenue, QUARTERLY, BASE, NONE
Instance 4: Revenue Forecast, Total Revenue, MONTHLY, BASE, YEAR_5
Instance 5: Revenue Forecast, EA Revenue, MONTHLY, BASE, NONE
Instance 6: Revenue Forecast, AS Revenue, MONTHLY, BASE, NONE
Instance 7: Price Forecast, Total Revenue, ANNUAL, BASE, NONE
```

All organized under one simple name! 🎉

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Prisma Generate

You'll see this when you restart the server:
```
✔ Generated Prisma Client
```

This is normal and expected.

### Old Database Columns

These columns still exist in the database (for safety) but are NOT in the Prisma schema:

**On CurveDefinition:**
- product
- curveType
- commodity
- granularity
- scenario
- degradationType

**You can drop them later** after confirming everything works:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "Forecasts"."CurveDefinition" 
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "product",
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "curveType",
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "commodity",
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "granularity",
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "scenario",
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "degradationType";
```

## 🧪 Expected Test Results

After restarting, you should see:

```
✅ GET /api/curves/definitions - 200 (simplified response)
✅ GET /api/curves/instances - 200 (includes all fields)
✅ GET /api/curves/data - 200 (working)
✅ GET /api/curves/data-with-pvalues - 200 (includes instance fields)
✅ GET /api/curves/locations - 200
✅ GET /api/curves/by-location-enhanced - 200 (updated query)
✅ GET /api/delivery-request/list - 200
✅ GET /api/delivery-request/setup - 200
✅ GET /api/admin/test-prisma - 200
✅ GET /api/admin/curve-field-values - 200 (gets from instances)

Total: 10/10 endpoints (100% ✅)
```
