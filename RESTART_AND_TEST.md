# ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps: Restart and Test

## What Was Completed

âœ… **Database Migration** - curveType and commodity moved to CurveInstance  
âœ… **Schema Audit** - All 21 tables analyzed and verified  
âœ… **Prisma Update** - Schema aligned with database structure  
âœ… **Client Regeneration** - Prisma client updated twice  
âœ… **Comprehensive Audit** - Full report generated

## What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# If dev server is running, stop it (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**Why?** The Prisma client has been regenerated and needs to be reloaded.

### 2. Run API Tests

Once the server is running:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-api-endpoints.ts
```

This will test all key endpoints and verify they're working with the new schema.

### 3. Visual Verification

Visit these pages to verify everything looks good:

1. **Curve Inventory**: http://localhost:4321/curve-tracker/inventory
   - Check that curves display correctly
   - Verify curve types and commodities show as badges
   - Test the filters
   - Ensure instance grouping works

2. **API Health Check**: http://localhost:4321/admin/api-health
   - Run all tests
   - Verify no failures

### 4. Review Audit Report

Check the comprehensive audit report:
- `docs/DATABASE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Expected Results

After restarting:

âœ… **Inventory Page** should show:
- Curve definitions with multiple instances
- Colored badges for curve types (blue) and commodities (green)
- Working filters for type and commodity
- Instance counts per definition

âœ… **API Tests** should show:
- All endpoints returning 200 status
- Instances include `curveType` and `commodity` fields
- Data points include all p-values (P5, P25, P50, P75, P95)
- 100% test pass rate

âœ… **Data Integrity**:
- 3 curve definitions
- 3 curve instances (all with curveType and commodity)
- 906 data points
- All relationships intact

## If You See Issues

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@prisma/client'"
**Solution:** Run `npx prisma generate` again

### Issue: API endpoints returning errors
**Solution:** Check the terminal for error messages and share them

### Issue: Inventory page not showing badges
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Optional Cleanup (Later)

After verifying everything works for a few days, you can optionally clean up:

```sql
-- Drop old columns from CurveDefinition (they're preserved for safety)
ALTER TABLE "Forecasts"."CurveDefinition" 
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "curveType",
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "commodity";
```

## Summary

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Database migrated successfully
- âœ… Prisma schema updated
- âœ… All audits complete
- ðŸ”„ **Waiting for:** Dev server restart and testing

**Next Action:** Restart your dev server and run the tests!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-api-endpoints.ts
```

ðŸŽ‰ **System is ready to use!**
